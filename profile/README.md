# MUDE GitHub Organization

This is the GitHub Organization for MUDE: Modelling, Uncertainty and Data for Engineers, a 1st year MSc course in the faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at Delft University of Technology. This GitHub Organization is used to share our book, public tools and resources. Most of it is shared as a website on https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/.

Source code for assignments is stored privately in https://github.com/mude-2025 and will be shared publicly yearly after the teaching finishes in https://github.com/TUDelft-MUDE/workbook-2025

For more information or editing access, email MUDE-CEG@tudelft.nl.
